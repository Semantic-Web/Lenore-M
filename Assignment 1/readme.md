Hi, This is to get you started with government data. Use Python to analyze the data here: http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/data-gov-visitor-metrics . Click on the Download button to download the .csv file. Aggregate the data by organization. For the date period given in the file, create and pretty print a table to show the top ten organizations (in terms of total views of the data during this period). Plot a barchart. Submit a .ipynb file at Github:https://github.com/Semantic-Web .I will soon start populating. I need your UNs for Github ASAP, whether you plan to do this assignment or not. I strongly urge you to give this a try - and ask for help at LinkedIn. It is OK - one of us will help. The goal is to help each other - your opportunity to contribute and help others will come.

Note that .ipynb is a 'literate programming' type of document - with text, code, and results integrated, as shown in the class and as in the .ipynb file attached to the Tutorial section's entry for Python. Use only Anaconda and not any advanced tool such as Jupyter (so I can open the file and execute the code).

Upload  to a separate folder in your Github Repo  that is entitled as "Assignment 1"



Did this, but did not mess about with getting the titles lines up msmoothly on the chart
